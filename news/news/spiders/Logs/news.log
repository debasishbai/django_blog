 'story': u'RANCHI: Indian skipper Virat Kohli said he had no regrets over a war of words with his Australian counterpart Steve Smith as the two sides prepare to resume their bitter battle for Test supremacy.\nKohli\'s explosive accusation after the second Test that Smith had been systematically abusing the Decision Review System (DRS) plunged the often tense relations between the two teams back into crisis mode.\nAustralia\'s board responded by calling the accusation "outrageous", prompting an equally vigorous defence of Kohli from his own employers.\nAlthough both Smith and Kohli escaped punishment from the International Cricket Council, they were summoned to clear-the-air talks ahead of the third Test which begins in Ranchi on Thursday.\nSpeaking to reporters on the eve of the match on Wednesday, Kohli said his focus was now on the cricket but he refused to back down on his claims against Smith.\n"I don\'t regret anything that I have said but at the same time it\'s very important not to be stupid and go on about the same thing on a daily basis," said Kohli.\n"I think it was a mature decision on everyone\'s part to move on.\nWe have seen instances in the past stretch on too long -- it just causes disharmony and there is no outcome to it.\n"It\'s time we focus on the remainder of the series.\nThere\'s a lot of cricket to be played and it should not happen in bad taste." India were furious when Smith was spotted looking up at his dressing-room for guidance in Bangalore on whether to seek a review of the umpire\'s decision after being given out lbw -- a clear breach of the DRS rules.\nWhile Smith called the incident on the fourth and final day a one-off "brain fade", Kohli said that "it\'s been happening for the last three days and it has to stop".\nIndia and Australia, the top two-ranked teams in Test cricket, have often been at loggerheads and relations hit a low point in 2008 when Indian spinner Harbhajan Singh was accused of calling Andrew Symonds a monkey.\nKohli himself was fined 50 percent of his match fee three years ago for bringing the game into disrepute after flashing the middle finger to the crowd in the Sydney Test.',

 'story': u'DUBAI: In a surprise development, Shashank Manohar today resigned as ICC chairman after merely eight months in office citing personal reasons.\nThe 59-year-old Manohar mailed his resignation letter to ICC CEO Dave Richardson without clarifying the exact reason for this sudden move to end what was to be a two-year-tenure.\nHowever, according to highly-placed sources Manohar has decided to quit as BCCI seems to have gained enough ground to block the constitutional and financial reforms that were set to be passed by the ICC at its next board meeting.\nAny reform to be passed needs 2/3rd majority but BCCI, in all likelihood, has managed to get Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe on its side.\nIt is learnt, expecting a loss of face, Manohar has resigned with immediate effect.\n"I was elected unopposed as the first independent Chairman of ICC last year.\nI have tried to do my best and have tried to be fair and impartial in deciding matters in the functioning of the Board and in matters related to Member Boards along with the able support of all Directors," Manohar has stated in his resignation letter.\n"However, for personal reasons it is not possible for me to hold the august office of ICC Chairman and hence I am tendering my resignation as Chairman with immediate effect.\n"I take this opportunity to thank all the Directors, the Management and staff of ICC for supporting me wholeheartedly.\nI wish ICC all the very best and hope it achieves greater heights," he concluded.\nManohar had last year resigned from the BCCI citing his inability to carry out Lodha Committee reforms in toto.\nHis detractors in BCCI at that time had said he left a sinking ship for the safer confines of the ICC.\nHe became the first independent chairman of ICC but had several run ins with BCCI on revenue sharing pattern.\nThe BCCI officials believe that for his personal ambitions to head the ICC, Manohar had not cared about the BCCI\'s interests.\nHis decision to bring in constitutional reforms has been severely opposed by BCCI along with Sri Lanka.\nThe ICC said it has received Manohar\'s resignation and will comment after taking stock of the situation.\n"The ICC has confirmed it has received an email from Chairman Shashank Manohar tendering his resignation.\nThe ICC Board will assess the situation and next steps before making a further announcement," the world body stated in a brief press release.',

 'story': u'China\'s accelerated military development and recent activity by its military aircraft+ and ships around Taiwan pose an increased threat to the self-ruled island, according to a Taiwanese government defence report draft reviewed by Reuters.\nThe 2017 Quadrennial Defence Review (QDR) also highlights the uncertainty over the future strategic direction of the United States in the region, the impact of Japan flexing its military capabilities and "conflict crisis" potential in the disputed South China Sea.\n"The recent activity of Chinese jets and ships around Taiwan shows the continued rise in (China\'s) military threat capabilities," highlighting the importance of Taiwan\'s need to defend itself, the review will say.\n"In addition to posing a military threat to our country, it also has a negative impact on regional stability." The document is due to be presented to parliament on Thursday by Taiwan defence minister Feng Shih-kuan.\nThe defence ministry had no comment on the report on Wednesday.\nThe four-yearly review is the first since President Tsai Ing-wen took office last May and the first under her Democratic Progressive Party, which traditionally advocates independence for Taiwan.\n"The country\'s military development and Taiwan\'s freedom and prosperity are the same living body," according to the draft.\nWAYWARD PROVINCE The QDR comes as China - which claims Taiwan as a wayward province to be taken back by force if necessary - has been stepping up air and sea military exercises in waters surrounding Taiwan as part of a sweeping modernisation of its armed forces.\nSpeaking in Beijing at his annual news conference on Wednesday, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang repeated that China was resolutely opposed to Taiwan independence but it would uphold peace across the Taiwan Strait.\n"No matter how the situation on the island may evolve, the fraternal bond between the two sides cannot be severed and will not be able to change history or the fact that both sides belong to one and the same China," Li said.\nDevelopments in the South China Sea, including rejection of an international court ruling by other claimants on territorial rights of the Philippines in the disputed waters, China\'s land reclamation and militarisation, and freedom of navigation patrols championed by the United States, could deepen strife in the area, the review will say.\n"Sovereignty disputes in the region and strategic competition could intensify, leading to hidden conflict crisis." China has begun new construction work on a disputed island in the South China Sea, satellite images show, just days ahead of the first official visit to the region by U.S.\nSecretary of State Rex Tillerson.\nThe review also listed Japan\'s move away from its pacifist constitution "to strengthen its armaments and lift a ban on using troops abroad" as having deep and far-reaching impacts on the security situation in the Asia-Pacific and the Taiwan Strait.\nReuters reported this week that Japan plans to send its largest warship on a three-month tour through the South China Sea beginning in May - its biggest show of naval force in the region since World War Two.\nAmong security challenges for Taiwan, the review also said "the United States\' Asia-Pacific strategic direction and troop deployment was not clear" under the new administration of President Donald Trump.\nTrump provoked consternation in Beijing by taking a congratulatory call from Taiwan\'s Tsai and then calling into question adherence to the "One China" policy, under which Washington acknowledges the Chinese position that there is only one China and Taiwan is part of it.\nLast month, Trump agreed to honour the policy during a phone call with Chinese leader Xi Jinping.\nThe United States remains Taiwan\'s biggest ally and arms supplier and is bound by legislation to provide the means to help the island defend itself.\nThe review reflected the realities of Taiwan\'s situation, but wasn\'t specific enough on how Tsai\'s government will address budget needs for major indigenous defence programmes or the shrinking number of soldiers in the armed forces, said Chieh Chung, a research fellow in the national security division of Taiwan\'s National Policy Foundation, a local think tank.\nThe review affirmed Taiwan\'s push to develop and build its own submarines, jets and ships, and strengthen its electronic and cyber defences against China.',

 'story': u'NEW DELHI: AAP national convenor Arvind Kejriwal today renewed his demand+ for paper ballots in Delhi municipal corporation polls and alleged that faulty Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) had led to the AAP\'s downfall in the state assembly elections, especially in Punjab+ .\nCiting exit polls which predicted AAP would sweep the Punjab Legislative Assembly election, Kejriwal questioned the outcome+ which was completely contrary to these forecasts.\n"Many said there is anger against Akalis and the AAP is sweeping polls.\nStill, AAP got 25 per cent votes and SAD got 31 per cent, how is this possible?" Kejriwal demanded.\nLaunching a scathing attack against the Congress and the SAD-BJP coalition, Kejriwal claimed that AAP\'s vote share in Punjab had been transferred to rival parties through tampered EVMs.\n"20-25 per cent of AAP\'s vote was transferred to SAD, which is why Congress won the election.\nAkali\'s victory would\'ve made it too obvious.\nThey wanted AAP to lose in any which way," the Delhi chief minister alleged at a press conference here.\nKejriwal then attempted to lend legitimacy to his allegations by referring to the Supreme Court\'s statement on EVMs.\n"Supreme Court has said that EVM is vulnerable to tampering, we aren\'t saying it.\nI know you all will make fun of me, hashtag me.\nBut if EVMs can be tampered with, that would mean the end of democracy in India," he said.\nAdmitting that he accepted the results in Goa, where the AAP had contested polls for the first time, Kejriwal called for a probe into the dubious EVMs.\n"We know it is too late to declare Punjab and Goa elections void, but this is for the future, faith has to be restored in the electoral process.\nThe suspicion of tampered EVMs must be investigated to increase voter confidence," the AAP leader said.\nAfter BSP supremo Mayawati, the Delhi chief minister had questioned the reliability of EVMs after facing a resounding defeat in the Goa assembly polls and finishing in third place in the Punjab election.\nDelhi Congress chief Ajay Maken also threw his weight+ behind Kejriwal\'s anti-electronic voting machine drive.\nKejriwal yesterday directed chief secretary MM Kutty to write to the state election commissioner, asking him to hold the upcoming municipal elections through ballot papers.',

 'story': u'RANCHI: Indian skipper Virat Kohli said he had no regrets over a war of words with his Australian counterpart Steve Smith as the two sides prepare to resume their bitter battle for Test supremacy.\nKohli\'s explosive accusation after the second Test that Smith had been systematically abusing the Decision Review System (DRS) plunged the often tense relations between the two teams back into crisis mode.\nAustralia\'s board responded by calling the accusation "outrageous", prompting an equally vigorous defence of Kohli from his own employers.\nAlthough both Smith and Kohli escaped punishment from the International Cricket Council, they were summoned to clear-the-air talks ahead of the third Test which begins in Ranchi on Thursday.\nSpeaking to reporters on the eve of the match on Wednesday, Kohli said his focus was now on the cricket but he refused to back down on his claims against Smith.\n"I don\'t regret anything that I have said but at the same time it\'s very important not to be stupid and go on about the same thing on a daily basis," said Kohli.\n"I think it was a mature decision on everyone\'s part to move on.\nWe have seen instances in the past stretch on too long -- it just causes disharmony and there is no outcome to it.\n"It\'s time we focus on the remainder of the series.\nThere\'s a lot of cricket to be played and it should not happen in bad taste." India were furious when Smith was spotted looking up at his dressing-room for guidance in Bangalore on whether to seek a review of the umpire\'s decision after being given out lbw -- a clear breach of the DRS rules.\nWhile Smith called the incident on the fourth and final day a one-off "brain fade", Kohli said that "it\'s been happening for the last three days and it has to stop".\nIndia and Australia, the top two-ranked teams in Test cricket, have often been at loggerheads and relations hit a low point in 2008 when Indian spinner Harbhajan Singh was accused of calling Andrew Symonds a monkey.\nKohli himself was fined 50 percent of his match fee three years ago for bringing the game into disrepute after flashing the middle finger to the crowd in the Sydney Test.',

 'story': u'China\'s accelerated military development and recent activity by its military aircraft+ and ships around Taiwan pose an increased threat to the self-ruled island, according to a Taiwanese government defence report draft reviewed by Reuters.\nThe 2017 Quadrennial Defence Review (QDR) also highlights the uncertainty over the future strategic direction of the United States in the region, the impact of Japan flexing its military capabilities and "conflict crisis" potential in the disputed South China Sea.\n"The recent activity of Chinese jets and ships around Taiwan shows the continued rise in (China\'s) military threat capabilities," highlighting the importance of Taiwan\'s need to defend itself, the review will say.\n"In addition to posing a military threat to our country, it also has a negative impact on regional stability." The document is due to be presented to parliament on Thursday by Taiwan defence minister Feng Shih-kuan.\nThe defence ministry had no comment on the report on Wednesday.\nThe four-yearly review is the first since President Tsai Ing-wen took office last May and the first under her Democratic Progressive Party, which traditionally advocates independence for Taiwan.\n"The country\'s military development and Taiwan\'s freedom and prosperity are the same living body," according to the draft.\nWAYWARD PROVINCE The QDR comes as China - which claims Taiwan as a wayward province to be taken back by force if necessary - has been stepping up air and sea military exercises in waters surrounding Taiwan as part of a sweeping modernisation of its armed forces.\nSpeaking in Beijing at his annual news conference on Wednesday, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang repeated that China was resolutely opposed to Taiwan independence but it would uphold peace across the Taiwan Strait.\n"No matter how the situation on the island may evolve, the fraternal bond between the two sides cannot be severed and will not be able to change history or the fact that both sides belong to one and the same China," Li said.\nDevelopments in the South China Sea, including rejection of an international court ruling by other claimants on territorial rights of the Philippines in the disputed waters, China\'s land reclamation and militarisation, and freedom of navigation patrols championed by the United States, could deepen strife in the area, the review will say.\n"Sovereignty disputes in the region and strategic competition could intensify, leading to hidden conflict crisis." China has begun new construction work on a disputed island in the South China Sea, satellite images show, just days ahead of the first official visit to the region by U.S.\nSecretary of State Rex Tillerson.\nThe review also listed Japan\'s move away from its pacifist constitution "to strengthen its armaments and lift a ban on using troops abroad" as having deep and far-reaching impacts on the security situation in the Asia-Pacific and the Taiwan Strait.\nReuters reported this week that Japan plans to send its largest warship on a three-month tour through the South China Sea beginning in May - its biggest show of naval force in the region since World War Two.\nAmong security challenges for Taiwan, the review also said "the United States\' Asia-Pacific strategic direction and troop deployment was not clear" under the new administration of President Donald Trump.\nTrump provoked consternation in Beijing by taking a congratulatory call from Taiwan\'s Tsai and then calling into question adherence to the "One China" policy, under which Washington acknowledges the Chinese position that there is only one China and Taiwan is part of it.\nLast month, Trump agreed to honour the policy during a phone call with Chinese leader Xi Jinping.\nThe United States remains Taiwan\'s biggest ally and arms supplier and is bound by legislation to provide the means to help the island defend itself.\nThe review reflected the realities of Taiwan\'s situation, but wasn\'t specific enough on how Tsai\'s government will address budget needs for major indigenous defence programmes or the shrinking number of soldiers in the armed forces, said Chieh Chung, a research fellow in the national security division of Taiwan\'s National Policy Foundation, a local think tank.\nThe review affirmed Taiwan\'s push to develop and build its own submarines, jets and ships, and strengthen its electronic and cyber defences against China.',

Kejriwal demanded.\nLaunching a scathing attack against the Congress and the SAD-BJP coalition, Kejriwal claimed that AAP\'s vote share in Punjab had been transferred to rival parties through tampered EVMs.\n"20-25 per cent of AAP\'s vote was transferred to SAD, which is why Congress won the election.\nAkali\'s victory would\'ve made it too obvious.\nThey wanted AAP to lose in any which way," the Delhi chief minister alleged at a press conference here.\nKejriwal then attempted to lend legitimacy to his allegations by referring to the Supreme Court\'s statement on EVMs.\n"Supreme Court has said that EVM is vulnerable to tampering, we aren\'t saying it.\nI know you all will make fun of me, hashtag me.\nBut if EVMs can be tampered with, that would mean the end of democracy in India," he said.\nAdmitting that he accepted the results in Goa, where the AAP had contested polls for the first time, Kejriwal called for a probe into the dubious EVMs.\n"We know it is too late to declare Punjab and Goa elections void, but this is for the future, faith has to be restored in the electoral process.\nThe suspicion of tampered EVMs must be investigated to increase voter confidence," the AAP leader said.\nAfter BSP supremo Mayawati, the Delhi chief minister had questioned the reliability of EVMs after facing a resounding defeat in the Goa assembly polls and finishing in third place in the Punjab election.\nDelhi Congress chief Ajay Maken also threw his weight+ behind Kejriwal\'s anti-electronic voting machine drive.\nKejriwal yesterday directed chief secretary MM Kutty to write to the state election commissioner, asking him to hold the upcoming municipal elections through ballot papers.',
